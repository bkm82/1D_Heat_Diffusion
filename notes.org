** TODO Update the mesher and solver naming from "differentiation matrix" to the "laplacian matrix
*** Degree_Matrix = degree of the node (i.e. how many nodes it is connected to)
example for a 1d 4 cell bar
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |

*** adjacency_matrix = matrix with a 1 if the node is connected else 0
example for a 1d 4 cell bar
#+attr_latex: :mode math :environment matrix
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |


*** laplacian_matrix L = D -A (degree_matrix-adjacency_matrix)
 #+attr_latex: :mode math :environment matrix
 |  2 | -1 |  0 |  0 |
 | -1 |  2 | -1 |  0 |
 |  0 | -1 |  2 | -1 |
 |  0 |  0 | -1 |

** TODO update references in the readme/examples for the heat euations to call heat_diffusion_mesh() instead of create_1d_mesh
